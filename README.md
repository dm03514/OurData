# OurData

## The Open Source Data Management Platform
Overview

Our-Data.org is an open source Data Management System.  It is a platform that allows for the easy sharing of data either programmatically or through a web interface.  It allows for individuals with no technical backgrounds to make data sets easily available.  It is completely open source.  Our-Data aims to lower the barrier involved with making government/organizational data accessible to those who can use it.

Our-Data should provide a number of features:

- Flexible Web interface that allows for the easy creation of data consumers (users)
- Flexible Web interface that allows for the easy creation of schemas (data structure)
- Simple web based/programatic based data import once schemas are created
- Users should have permissions that define what types of requests they can make (CRUD) through which interfaces they can make them (web, programmatically), how long they are allowed to have access to the data, and which fields they are allowed access to.
- Reporting tools that describe types of requests, frequencies of request to better understand how data is being consumed/accessed (log parser?, hadoop?)
- A completely open source code base allowing organizations to set up the system on their own servers, or a hosted solution that lowers the technical barrier to entry even further
- The a ability to handle large numbers of requests and uploads efficiently. aka good performance.
- The ability to handle huge data sets.


Our-data.org was inspired by a couple of things.  There doesnâ€™t exist an open source data platform that allows for easy management of large data sets.  Communication between the government and necessary organizations is horrid at best.  Take health insurance for example.  Many specialists, doctors, healers (anyone that accepts insurance) need to spend long manual hours communicating with insurance providers about clients and their coverage.  This should not be a manual process.
